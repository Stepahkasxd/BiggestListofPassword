This is a list of generated unique passwords for brute force, in this repository you will find already generated lists and a Python script that also generates lists


What does it mean?

L- Letters 
N- Numbers 
S- Special characters 
(x)m - number of millions of characters
(rR) - Registers

That is, the file name LNrR25m.txt means that the file contains 25 million passwords. Letters and Numbers with different registers are used, but there are no special characters.


That ALL Good Luck =)
